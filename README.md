## Contribution Statistics

I contributed articles and code examples to the [`liferay-learn`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-learn) repository for Liferay DXP/Portal 7.2+ and the [`liferay-docs`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs) repository for Liferay DXP/Portal versions 6.0 through 7.2.

### Contributions to the `liferay-learn` Repository

I contributed over 28% of the [`liferay-learn`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-learn) repository Liferay DXP documentation commits.

> Note that `d2021402cd7dae764436c9d4b1563a5fdac0bb13` was the last `liferay-learn` docs commit I authored at Liferay. See <https://github.com/liferay/liferay-learn/commit/d2021402cd7dae764436c9d4b1563a5fdac0bb13>.

Calculations:

1. Go to the DXP docs folder:

    ```bash
    $ cd liferay-learn\docs\dxp\latest\en
    ```

1. Count the total commits up to and including my last commit.

    ```bash
    $ git rev-list --count d2021402cd7dae764436c9d4b1563a5fdac0bb13
    8782
    ```

1. Count my commits.

    ```bash
    $ git shortlog -sn --all d2021402cd7dae764436c9d4b1563a5fdac0bb13 | grep -i hinkey
    1250  jhinkey
    667  James Hinkey
    544  Jim Hinkey
    ```

    Total `liferay-learn` commits by me: `1250 + 667 + 544 = 2461`

1. Calculate the percentage of commits by me: `2461 / 8782 = .28 = 28%`

Here is a listing of my commits: <https://github.com/liferay/liferay-learn/commits/master?author=james.hinkey@liferay.com>

### Contributions to the `liferay-docs` Repository

I contributed over 23% of the [`liferay-docs`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs) repository Liferay DXP/Portal 7.2 (`master`) documentation commits.

> Note that `7144674c38be1d1ecdad404f49c157f9064de25c` was the last `liferay-docs` commit I authored at Liferay. See <https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/commit/7144674c38be1d1ecdad404f49c157f9064de25c#diff-dbd3a49d0d906b4ed9216b73330d2fb080ef2f758c12f3885068222e5e17151c>.
