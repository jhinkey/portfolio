## Product / Feature Introduction

Below is a product introduction article.

* [What is Apperate?](https://github.com/iexcloud/docs/blob/main/source/getting-started/what-is-iex-cloud-apperate.md) describes the IEX Cloud Apperate product and how it helps you integrate data for financial tech (fintech) applications.

## How-To Guides

I created the following articles to help all kinds of audiences complete tasks.

### For Developers

* [Write and Read Data](https://github.com/iexcloud/docs/blob/main/source/getting-started/write-and-read-data.md) to Apperate using this JavaScript client library.

* [Using Asynchronous Messaging](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/liferay-development/core-frameworks/message-bus/using-asynchronous-messaging) is easy to implement. Here we'll deploy an example project and examine its components.

* [Query the Financial Data API](https://iexcloud.io/documentation/using-core-data/query-core-data.html) using the IEX Cloud Data API; then adjust your queries to further filter on the exact data you want.

### For Users

* [Get Started with Apperate](https://github.com/iexcloud/docs/blob/main/source/getting-started/getting-started-with-apperate.md) guides the user through creating a workspace, generating a dataset, and viewing the dataset's auto-generated API reference page.  

* [Manage Users](https://iexcloud.io/documentation/administration/managing-users.html) in IEX Cloud via the Console.

* [Load Data from an AWS S3 Bucket](https://github.com/iexcloud/docs/blob/main/source/load-data/loading-data-from-aws-s3.md) to Apperate for your fintech application.

* [Design a Schema](https://github.com/iexcloud/docs/blob/main/source/managing-your-data/defining-schemas/define-a-schema.md) for your fintech application.

* [Running Liferay for the First Time](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/running-liferay-for-the-first-time) is as easy as following a few easy steps.

### For System Administrators

* [Using Liferay Docker Images](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/using-liferay-docker-images.html) demonstrates starting, monitoring, and stopping Liferay Portal via Docker from the command line.

## API Reference

These articles show the content I created for getting started with and using the IEX Cloud API.

* [API Reference Home](https://iexcloud.io/docs/) introduces the IEX Cloud API and uses instructions and animated GIFs to demonstrate using it. 

* [Stock Quote](https://iexcloud.io/docs/core/QUOTE) specifies the Stock Quote endpoint including its HTTP method signature, path parameters, query parameters, and response attributes. It also includes example HTTP request URLs and links to the data bundle for purchasing access to the endpoint.

* [Basics Section](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api-basics) provides essentials on using the API and links to important information on error codes, versioning, deprecation, and more.

## Concept Articles

These articles I wrote helped people understand some non-trivial topics.

* [Message Bus](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/building-applications/core-frameworks/message-bus.html) introduces programatic communication from message Senders to message Listeners via Destinations; also it introduces asynchronous and synchronous messaging approaches.

* [Architecture](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/liferay-internals/architecture.html) uses  text, diagrams, and examples to explain Liferay Portal's design and benefits.

## Home Pages and Doc Hierarchies

The following pages demonstrate how I've organized and presented initial content to users.

### IEX Cloud Guides

* [Guides Home Page](https://iexcloud.io/documentation/index.html) promotes the most important IEX Cloud topics to get users where the need to go fast.
